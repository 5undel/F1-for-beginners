    <h2>What is formula One</h2>
    <p>
        Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) restarted after the secund world war in 1950s.
        The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform.
        A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.
        The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World Championships: one for drivers, the other for constructors. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA.The races must run on tracks graded "1" (formerly "A"), the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA.
        Most events occur in rural locations on purpose-built tracks, but several events take place on city streets.
