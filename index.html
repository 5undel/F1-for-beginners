                <p>Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international auto racing for
                    single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).
                    The World Drivers' Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has
                    been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in 1950.</p>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <p>The results of each race are evaluated using a points system to determine two annual World
                    Championships: one for drivers, the other for constructors. Each driver must hold a valid Super
                    Licence, the highest class of racing licence issued by the FIA.The races must run on tracks graded
                    "1" (formerly "A"), the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA.Most events occur in rural locations
                    on purpose-built tracks, but several events take place on city streets.</p>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <p>FIA is an association established on 20 June 1904 to represent the interests of motoring
                    organisations and motor car users. To the general public, the FIA is mostly known as the governing
                    body for many auto racing events, such as the well-known Formula One. The FIA also promotes road
                    safety around the world.</p>
                <hr>
                <p>While Europe is the sport's traditional base, the championship operates globally, with 13 of the 23
                    races in the 2021 season taking place outside Europe. With the annual cost of running a mid-tier
                    team – designing, building, and maintaining cars, pay, transport – being US$120 million.</p>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <p>cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, owing to very high cornering
                    speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce.</p>
