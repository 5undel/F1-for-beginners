        <p>
        Participants in Formula One are not individuals but teams.
        You may not realise it, but each Formula One team employs hundreds of technicians, engineers and support staff.
        If you include the designers and the assembly employees, that number could well exceed one thousand.
        There were ten teams enrolled for the 2021 Formula One season with two cars each.
        </p>
    <p>
        A formula One team comprises all the entities that design and produce the car and own the intellectual rights. Therefore if the chassis is designed by one company and the engine is supplied by another, the two taken together become the participating team. That is the reason you will hear names like Benetton-Ford or Williams-Renault.
    </p>    
    <h4>Here is the list for the 2021 season of the teams and driver</h4>
