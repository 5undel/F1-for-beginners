                <h2>Practice</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>The first two practice runs for 1.5h on Friday. This practice is mostly partly for so the team can 
                    set up the cars and run different tests.This is done because all racetracks vary in layout, so the cars have to be changed for each race.
                    During this time, the teams check how the car reacts to the track, you check that the car delivers the right amount of downforce. You check that the air flow is correct.
                    You also do different simulations that you can use the date for the race on Sundays.
                    They do different fuel simulations, race simulations to find out how the tires will hold for the race on Sunday.For each race, the teams have 3 different types of tires that you can use. A hard, a medium and a soft pair of tires.
                    All this in order to be able to set up a strategy to get the most out of the car and the drivers.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>A qualifying session is held before each race to determine the order cars will be lined up in at the start of the race.
                    <br>
                    They started with Q3 where all 20 cars are included to qualify for Q2.And in Q3 the drivers are allowed to use whatever type of tire they want to qualify further.
                    In Q2, the 15 fastest cars go on to qualify for Q1. But in Q2, it is the tires you qualify to Q1 that you have to start the race with.
                    And in Q1 we have the 10 fastest cars that make up for the top 10 places in the line. And in Q1 you are allowed to use once again whichever tire you want.</p></p>

                        Sunday's race begins with a formation lap, where the cars drive one lap of the track to warm up the tires and brakes. After that, they are lined up on the starting stage according to how they qualified.
                        So-called "pole" first place with the fastest time, 2nd with the second fastest and so on.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Races last for a set number of laps (totalling 305 km/190 miles), or two hours of racing time, whichever occurs sooner. If there is a delay in the action, for example because of a crash, there’s a cap at three hours of real time.
                        Cars may start the race with up to 110 kg (242 lbs) of fuel (being unleaded fuel akin to that which you put in your road car); in-race refuelling has been banned for safety reasons since 2010. The cars therefore travel much faster toward the end of a race, as they chew through that fuel and become lighter.
                        Various penalties may be levied against drivers by the race director for rule infringements, depending on their severity: 5- or 10-second time penalties (which must be served at the driver’s next pit stop, or, if they do not pit again for the rest of the race, is added to their total race time); a drive-through penalty, whereby the offender must drive through the pits (at the mandated lower speed); or a stop-go penalty, which compels the driver to drive into the pits and sit stationary for 10 seconds before re-joining the action. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In the event of a crash or other safety concern, it may be too dangerous to permit full-speed racing to continue while the matter is addressed. The race director may therefore deploy the safety car, which is a sufficiently-equipped road car (driven by a gentleman named Bernd Mylander since 2000) which comes out on track to control the speed of the cars on track while an incident is being attended to by safety crews. The cars must slow down and follow behind the safety car (which travels as fast as it can, but still much, much slower than the racecars), and no overtaking is permitted. A safety car throws a spanner into the works of a Grand Prix—it bunches up the pack, and since the cars on track must slow down to follow the safety car, drivers may pick up a cheap pit stop: less time is lost by ducking into the pits, since everyone on track is travelling much slower than usual. A well- or poorly-timed safety car can make or ruin a driver’s race.
                        A less dangerous track incident may result in the deployment of the virtual safety car, a measure introduced after the fatal crash of Jules Bianchi at the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix. It is (as the name suggests) not a real car, but a procedure whereby drivers are compelled to drive at a mandated speed of around 70 percent of their standard with no overtaking, in a manner which maintains the gaps between the cars but does not risk further incidents at insanely high race speeds. The drivers must, essentially, keep time with an imaginary car, and are shown through their steering wheel’s screen how their pace compares with the virtual safety car’s pace (and must make adjustments accordingly).
                        At an even lower level of seriousness, race marshals may wave yellow flags, which requires drivers to slow down and prohibits them from overtaking. If an incident is of such seriousness as to make racing too dangerous (for example if a crashed car is in the middle of the track), the red flag is flown, meaning that the race is suspended and the cars are to return to the pits until further notice.

                        Points are awarded to the top 10 finishers in each race, which count toward the championship races: 25 points for the winner, 18 for second and 15 for third, down to a solitary point for 10th place. An additional point is awarded to the driver who earns the fastest lap, so long as they finish in the top 10.
