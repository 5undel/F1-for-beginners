        <h3>Practice</h3>
        <p>
            The first two practice runs for 1.5h on Friday. This practice is mostly partly for so the team can 
            set up the cars and run different tests.This is done because all racetracks vary in layout, so the cars have to be changed for each race.
            During this time, the teams check how the car reacts to the track, you check that the car delivers the right amount of downforce. You check that the air flow is correct.
            You also do different simulations that you can use the date for the race on Sundays.
            They do different fuel simulations, race simulations to find out how the tires will hold for the race on Sunday.For each race, the teams have 3 different types of tires that you can use. A hard, a medium and a soft pair of tires.
             All this in order to be able to set up a strategy to get the most out of the car and the drivers.

        <h3>Qualifying</h3>
        <p>
            A qualifying session is held before each race to determine the order cars will be lined up in at the start of the race.
            <br>
            They started with Q3 where all 20 cars are included to qualify for Q2.And in Q3 the drivers are allowed to use whatever type of tire they want to qualify further.
            In Q2, the 15 fastest cars go on to qualify for Q1. But in Q2, it is the tires you qualify to Q1 that you have to start the race with.
            And in Q1 we have the 10 fastest cars that make up for the top 10 places in the line. And in Q1 you are allowed to use once again whichever tire you want.
